        <h1>Primitive Data Types</h1>
        <p>The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data <br>types. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.</p>
        <li>Number: JavaScript numbers are always stored in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. Unlike other programming languages, you don’t need int, float, etc to declare different numeric values.</li> 
        <li>String: JavaScript Strings are similar to sentences. They are made up of a list of characters, which is essentially just an “array of characters, like “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.</li> 
        <li>Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.</li> 
        <li>Null: This type has only one value that is null.</li> 
        <li>Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.</li> 
        <li>Symbol: Symbols return unique identifiers that can be used to add unique property keys to an object that won’t collide with keys of any other code that might add to the object.</li>

        <h1>Non-Primitive Data Types:</h1>
         <p>The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non <br>-primitive data types. It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.</p>
        <li>Number: JavaScript numbers are always stored in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. Unlike other programming languages, you don’t need int, float, etc to declare different numeric values.</li>

    <h1>JavaScript Primitive Data Types Examples:</h1>
    <p>Number:</p>
    <script>
        let num2 = 1.3; // Floating point number
        let num3 = Infinity; // Infinity
        let num = 2; // Integer 
        let num4 = 'something here too'/2; // NaN
    </script>
        <p>String:</p>
        <script>
        let str = "Hello There";
        let str2 = 'Single quotes works fine';
        let phrase = `can embed ${str}`;
        </script>
            </script>
            <p>Boolean:</p>
            <script>
             let isCoding = true; // yes
             let isOld = false;      // no
            </script>
            </script>

            </script>

                // Each time Symbol() method 
                // is used to create new global Symbol
                console.log(symbol1 == symbol2); // False
